      <p class="p-header"><strong>Hello! I'm Nitesh. I like to make things.</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>I'm a fourth year <a class="inline-link" href="http://catalogue.uci.edu/interdisciplinarystudies/computerscienceandengineering/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> student at the <a class="inline-link" href="https://uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine.</a>
      I am currently seeking a full-time position as a <em>Software Engineer</em> at a company that has a positive impact in the world and fosters individual growth.</p>
      <p>Aside from being a full-time student, I am an iOS intern at <a class="inline-link" href="https://fusionofideas.com/">Fusion of Ideas</a>, where I help build custom mobile applications for businesses of all sizes. The majority of my time is split between school and Fusion.</p>
      <p>As for my personal interests, I'm passionate about health and fitness. Whenever school or work gets too stressful, exersise helps me keep my sanity. I try to either run or lift weights at least four times per week.
      I also love music (the photo to the left is from <a class="inline-link" href="http://www.rollingloud.com/">Rolling Loud 2018</a>) and I've recently started producing my own songs, which you can listen to <a class="inline-link" href="https://soundcloud.com/hitnes">here.</a></p>
      <p>I live my life by three guidelines: <strong>do what you love, surround yourself with people you love, and give back when you can.</strong> Take a look at the other sections of my portfolio to see what I do!</p>
