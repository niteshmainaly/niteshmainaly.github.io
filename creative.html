      <p>From the <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9Y-RgEbNI">Bollywood songs</a> of my early years to <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApXoWvfEYVU">the melodic hip-hop gems</a> I enjoy today, music has always been a big part of my life.
      Until last year, however, I've always been a consumer, rather than a creator. That changed when I purchased a copy of <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a>, one of the leading music production environments, just for fun. I immediately discovered a new passion.</p>
      <p>Music is freedom: the possibilities are endless. Yes, certain notes and chords sound <em>better</em> in succession, certain patterns feel more <em>rhythmic</em> but this is completely subjective. There is no right or wrong in music. Music is like life: there is no specific goal, no finish line. It is truly about the journey.</p>
      <p>Creating my own music has given me a deeper appreciation of music in general, in addition to being my primary artistic outlet. I am a complete amature by all means, but I will never stop experimenting. As a consumer and a creator, music will always be a big part of my life.</p>

      <p>Ahh, Youtube. I have fond memories of discovering strange and wonderful videos and sharing them with friends. Who could forget Ryan Higa's classic <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdLCEwEFCMU">How to be a Ninja</a> or the <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4">music video</a> for Justin Bieber's "Baby." (one of the most disliked videos on the platform, for good reason).</p>
      <p>Youtube has not only served as a record of our ever-changing culture, it has <em>shaped our culture</em> by giving a voice, a platform of expression to thousands of personalities, opinions, and ideas that would have never made it on traditional platforms like TV. Watching videos from creators like Ryan Higa, Smosh, KevJumba, etc., inspired to to experiment with video production and, more importantly, encouraged me to share the videos that I produced.
      As with music production, I am by all means an amature, occasionally making silly videos with his friends. But I love it, and I will continue making and posting videos on Youtube (inconsistently) as long as I am able.</p>
