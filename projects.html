      <iframe id="salary" title="UCI Salaries" width="60%" height="400" src="money.html"></iframe>
      <p class="par-text"><em>UCI Salaries</em> was created with the goal of increasing transparency: students should know exactly where their money is going. To that end, the website contains a searchable database of UCI faculty members and their salaries.
      The <em>salary</em> information was <a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">scraped</a> from the <a class="inline-link" href="https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu/wage/">official UC payroll database</a>
      using Python, specifically the library  <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a>. The <em>title</em> and <em>department</em> information was obtained using the same tools from
      <a class="inline-link" href="https://directory.uci.edu/">the UCI Campus Directory</a>.</p>

      <img id="timeismoney" src="images/timeismoney2.png" alt="Time is Money">
      <p id="sidetext">In my junior year, I found myself afflicted with a severe Youtube addiction. I was spending hours every day binging random, useless videos. The problem was: I had no idea how much time I was wasting.
      That's when I got the idea for a Google Chrome extension, <a class="inline-link" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/time-is-money-productivit/becejeflehininoffjnminjekkfmnglo">Time is Money - Productivity Tracker</a>.
      The extension allows users to see how much time they spend on each website by day, week and month. I built the extension primarily with JavaScript and a tiny bit of HTML, using Chrome APIs to store user data locally.
      <br><br>After personally testing the extension for a few days, I was shocked by how much time I spent on social media and Youtube, which really motivated me to stop procrastinating and kept me accountable.
      To help others dealing with procrastination, I decided to put my extension up on the Chrome Web Store, free to download. You can find it <a class="inline-link" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/time-is-money-productivit/becejeflehininoffjnminjekkfmnglo">here</a>.</p>
